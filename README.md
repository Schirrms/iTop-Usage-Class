# iTop-Usage-Class
Adds an Usage Category to any object. In my case, that's Production/Dev/Test...

In our environment, we like to know in a glance if a resource is a production ressource, or a Dev resource, or a test device.
Instead of creating another text field in my objects, I choose to create a new class, so :

1) The number of category is (normally) limited

2) It's also possible to do sa search starting from the category (all production items, for example)

A this time, while this class is technically available for most if not all other classes, I only added it in the 'Server' and 'Virtual Machine' screen. Don't hesitate to ask for more items, it should for me be everywhere (but time is always short...)

Hope this can be useful for other :)

And : "iTop Rocks" (never miss an occasion to tell that :-))
